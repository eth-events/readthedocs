Alerting
========
Make sure you can access the alerting feature by opening the `Dashboard <https://account.eth.events/alerting/dashboard/>`__.
You should see an (empty) list of alerting rules.

Frontend Usage
--------------
Just hit `+ New` on the `Dashboard page <https://account.eth.events/alerting/dashboard/>`__ to add a new alerting rule.
Give it a name, select the network and configure when your data is considered *final*.
See the [Example section](#examples) for the actual configuration.


API Usage
---------
You can access the API with cURL or your preferred REST library. See `the documentation <endpoints/index>`__ for authorization details.
