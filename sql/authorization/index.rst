Authorization
=============
To access the SQL interface you need to retrieve your access credentials.

You can register for a **free** account and get the SQL access credentials right now at `https://account.eth.events/ <https://account.eth.events/api/token/>`_ in just a few seconds. Go ahead, I'll wait.

Decide on a SQL-Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Get yourself a proper SQL-Client to access our database. We currently favour PGAdmin4, but it's up to you:

* `PGAdmin4 <https://www.pgadmin.org/download/>`_
* `Valentino Studio <https://valentina-db.com/en/valentina-studio-overview>`_

Connect to the database
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Setup your connection as mentioned in the account backend. If you need help or occur any error, please don't hesitate to ask for help from us.

Note
^^^^
Please keep in mind that the SQL interface is still in a beta status, hence the service might not be constantly available and the database
schema could change from one day through another. 
Now you might proceed using the SQL database or go on to the :doc:`tutorial <../tutorials/index>`.
